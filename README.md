# Welcome to the release branch of Universal82/TCPP!
## Everything is broken right now, don't even worry about it :3
TCPP is a (Linux only for now) library for creating tcp connections in an intuitive manner.
We-and by we I mean I-want it to be as easy as using std::cout, so both to challenge myself
in making more complex programs I have decided that I'm going to need to have some form of
code for managing internet connections, and thus MossTCPP was born! Well made actually, but
you get the point.

Do keep in mind that this is only a personal growth project and will almost certain be broken
and buggy. If you're looking for a network library I've heard good things about Boost asio,
never used it myself though.

Where I'm at right now: Fixing it
Notes: As this is the first version, it's broken.
This is much better than before when it didn't even compile.


### Disclaimer:
Everything in src/examples isn't mine, completely yoinked so I could reference it and study how it works.
